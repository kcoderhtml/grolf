# grolf arcade bot

Your friendly lightweight arcade helper written in Bun and hosted on nest! ðŸ˜Ž

Claim to fame: I demoed this to the founder of Github!

## Creating the apps

You need a slack app with the following manifest

```yaml
display_information:
  name: Grolf
  description: This grolf has a special FÃ¤higkeiten which is to grab your git commits and plop them somewhere
  background_color: "#203020"
  long_description: They call me Grolf, though whispers in the forest say I'm born from moonlight and fallen leaves. I wouldn't know, honestly, my memories start with the damp earth and the sweet smell of moss. I'm not much to look at, a furry green fellow with a single, bright leaf sprouting from my back. But don't let that fool you! Lately, I feel a strange pull towards the programmers' world, a place buzzing with light and strange symbols. Sometimes, I can't resist grabbing a sparkly wisp of code from their machines and dropping it right in their online hangout. They get flustered, these programmers, but hey, a little chaos never hurt anyone, right? Besides, who knows, maybe they'll find a missing piece of their puzzle in my little gifts.

```

and a github app with the commit status and contents permissions as well as the mandatory metadata permission. You also need to configure the app webhook to send events to `https://your-app-url.ngrok-free.app/gh` as well as the callback url to `https://your-app-url.ngrok-free.app/gh`

## Installing

Install the dependencies first

```bash
bun install
```

### Running the Slackbot

First migrate the db so you have a local copy of the database then you can run the dev script to start the server!

```bash
bunx prisma migrate dev --name db
bun run dev
```

You probably also want to run the ngrok tunnel so that your slackbot can get events from slack (double check the package.json to make sure that you changed the url to your ngrok url)

```bash
bun run ngrok
```

## Development

### Database

If you change the schema.prisma file you will need to run the following command to update the database schema

```bash
bunx prisma migrate dev
```

alternatively you can use the db push command which is a more prod friendly command

```bash
bunx prisma db push
```

## Production

Use the docker-compose file to run the app in production

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
